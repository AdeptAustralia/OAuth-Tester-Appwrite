<h1> üîñ Appwrite OAuth Tester With React<a href="#-note">*</a></h1>

<img width="18%" align="right" src="https://appwrite.io/images-ee/press/badge-pink-button.svg" />

A OAuth Tester app built with Appwrite and React to test OAuth Providers in Appwrite. Made to test new providers easily.

## üé¨ Getting Started

### ü§ò Installation
Follow this simple [Installation Guide](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation) to get Appwrite up and running in no time. You can either deploy Appwrite on your local machine or, on any cloud provider of your choice. 

> Note: If you setup Appwrite on your local machine, you will need to create a public IP so that your hosted frontend can access it.
  
We need to make a few configuration changes to your Appwrite server. 

1. Clone and Create a ```.env``` in root of this project with the following vars:
    * REACT_APP_ENDPOINT - Your Appwrite endpoint
    * REACT_APP_PROJECT - Your Appwrite project ID
    * REACT_APP_LOGINURL - Login Page URL of OAuth Tester (e.g. http://localhost:3000/login)

2. Add a new Web App in Appwrite and enter the endpoint of your website (`localhost, <project-name>.vercel.app etc`)

4. Open ```Login.js``` in the same directory and add this after Line 7:
    * Add a button after Line 18 (You can take help from examples already written there) like:
        ```
        <button
          type="submit"
          className="mx-auto mt-4 py-2 px-16 font-semibold rounded-lg shadow-md bg-white text-gray-900 border border-gray-900 hover:border-transparent hover:text-white hover:bg-gray-900 focus:outline-none disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
          onClick={() => {loginWith(`provider-name`)}}
        >
          Your-Provider-Name
        </button>
        ```
    * Remember to replace ```provider-name``` with a valid Provider (which is available in appwrite) in small casings (e.g. ```discord```)
5. Run Dev Server ```npm run start```

### üöÄ Deploy the Front End
**Fork it and make necessary changes first**

You have two options to deploy the front-end and we will cover both of them here. In either case, you will need to fill in these environment variables that help your frontend connect to Appwrite.

* REACT_APP_ENDPOINT - Your Appwrite endpoint
* REACT_APP_PROJECT - Your Appwrite project ID
* REACT_APP_LOGINURL - Login Page URL of OAuth Tester (e.g. http://localhost:3000/login)
